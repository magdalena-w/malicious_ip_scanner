# Simple malicious IP address detector
This program was created to detect malicious IP addresses using VirusTotal API. Logs are generated by the Cowrie honeypot. 

#### Cowrie honeypot
A medium interaction SSH and Telnet honeypot designed to log brute force attacks and shell interaction performed by an attacker. Cowrie also functions as an SSH and telnet proxy to observe attacker behavior to another system.

#### Adding API Keys to System Environment Variables

On Linux (or Mac):

- Open the file in your favourite text editor
- Add a new line to the file, e.g.:
`export VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=<your_secret_key>`
- Save your file

On Windows:
- Search in Start menu "Edit the system environment variables"
- Click "Environment variables"
- Click on "New..." button to add a user variable
- Create new variable e.g. VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY and set the value to the secret key
